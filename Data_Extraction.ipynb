And while it’s possible that old players can still access and play the game,  new gamers will no doubt be upset about this move.</p><p>There’s also the fact that the company’s shares have been bleeding of late. Investors lost $16 Billion in a single day of trading after the ban was implemented. However, do note that India only <a href=\"https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/india-bans-54-chinese-apps-on-security-concerns-economic-times\" rel=\"noopener\">accounted for</a> 2.6% of Sea Ltd’s gaming revenues in 2021. And so, while the ban may have had an impact on investor sentiment, there’s likely more to this story than what meets the eye.</p><p>Finally, the Singaporean government. Why are they upset?</p><p>Well, that’s because Sea Limited isn’t just any random enterprise. It is the largest tech company in the island nation. A company nurtured by the Singaporean ecosystem. They aren’t just responsible for making cool games. But they also own Shopee, a social commerce company and SeaMoney —  a financial services division. To lend more gravitas, CEO Forrest Li is also on Singapore’s economic development board.</p><p>So, you see, Sea Ltd is a big deal.</p><p>And that leaves us with one final question — Why did India ban Free Fire in the first place?</p><p>Well, the Indian government didn’t just ban Free Fire. They also banned 54 other apps with apparent links to China.</p><p>But is Free Fire really of Chinese origin?</p><p>Well, its CEO Forrest Li was born in China but is a citizen of Singapore. And there’s the fact that the Chinese social media giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. is the largest shareholder in the company. So could this be the reason?</p><p>Well sure, that might be a concern. But you could argue that this argument isn’t particularly convincing. After all, Chinese conglomerate Ant Group is the largest shareholder of Paytm.

Because here’s another thing. Free Fire has a premium version called Free Fire Max. It’s the same game but in HD!

If Chris Wood simply said that the Sensex could deliver a yearly return of 12% over the next 5 years, we wouldn’t have batted an eyelid. We would’ve shrugged and just got on with our lives.

Tech stocks were going to the moon! And these good folks predicted that nothing would stop the bull run. So out came the prediction of 36,000 on Dow. But the stock market doesn’t care for what you feel. It has a mind of its own. So, instead of continuing to move up, the Dow cracked from 11,000 in 2000 to 8,000 in 2003. And the prediction flopped miserably.</p><p>And Chris Wood’s prediction? Well, he made that when the Sensex hit 60,000.

For me, it was Aarti. Aarti Industries. <br/><br/>I picked it up in 2014 as a newbie investor. I’d just finished my masters programme and was interviewing for a job at a wealth management company. I wanted to put my newly acquired equity research skills to impress the folks there. So I looked at stocks that were being discussed on online forums and Aarti caught my eye. I did my analysis and my “spreadsheet” told me the stock was undervalued. 3 months later, the stock had already jumped 50%. I cursed myself for not buying the stock. And I quickly rushed to invest ₹10,000 (because that’s all I had back then). I only sold the stock in March 2022. Just before the market crashed. I made a cool 900% gain during this period. <br/><br/>It’s a great story, isn’t it? A true story of my first multibagger stock. <br/><br/>And that’s what investing in stocks gives us — stories. That’s what draws people into the stock markets. A good story and the lure of quick money!<br/><br/>But here’s the thing. There’s something I skipped in the story. The part about luck! Because even when I bought the stock, I didn’t know anything about Aarti Industries. I didn’t know anything about the speciality chemicals industry. I got lucky and made money. <br/><br/>Also, I only shared one story in which my skills (read luck) shone through. I didn’t tell you how I lost money in other stocks I picked up over the years. And most people will be like me. They’ll regale you with stories about their multibaggers. And they’ll conveniently avoid talking about all the duds they bought. You don’t hear about it because no one wants to look silly. <br/><br/>And since we only hear stories about those great stock picks that our friends (or those on Twitter) make, it’s tempting to jump in and try our luck as well. We want to be cool. And that’s okay!

INSANE. Some idiot used my Pan to take a 2000 RS loan and FCK’d my CIBIL score and @IVLSecurities did nothing to help sort. HOW DOES INDIA BULLS ALLOW THIS @ibhomeloans @CIBIL_Official”</em></p><p>That was a <a href=\"https://theprint.in/india/actor-sunny-leone-claims-identity-theft-pan-details-allegedly-used-for-fintech-loan-fraud/835110/#google_vignette\" rel=\"noopener\">tweet</a> from Sunny Leone (later deleted) posted on the 17th of February</p><p>Wait, why are we talking about Sunny Leone?</p><p>Well, in case you haven’t heard, a loan fraud is doing the rounds in India. And it’s wreaking havoc on credit scores. It has all the markings of identity theft. You know when some dubious individual gets his hands on an unsuspecting person’s unique identity number and then uses the information to commit financial frauds.</p><p>For instance, take Sunny Leone’s case. Someone used her identity, took out a loan of about ₹2,000 and then defaulted on payments. When you default on payments your credit score goes for a toss. And that can impact so many things. Banks may refuse to dole out new loans. You may be asked to pay a higher interest rate. And you may even have trouble getting your hands on a credit card.</p><p>For what?</p><p>For something, you didn’t even do. It’s crazy, right? Anyway, it wasn’t just Sunny Leone. Reuters tech journalist Aditya Kalra <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adityakalra/status/1492897511052242946\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeted</a> about something similar. And on 14th February, communications consultant Karthik Srinivasan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beastoftraal/status/1494250241402441734\" rel=\"noopener\">followed</a> it up with his experience. Soon enough, this kicked up a storm on Twitter with so many people sharing similar stories.</p><p>And the entity that’s in the midst of this brouhaha? Dhani Loans and Services Ltd.</p><p>In case the name Dhani doesn’t ring a bell, maybe you know them by another name — Indiabulls. Yeah, they’re part of the Indiabulls Group — who have quite the presence in the real estate and housing loan markets. And Dhani — earlier called Indiabulls Consumer Finance doles out consumer loans.</p><p>But how did this happen?</p><p>How did fraudsters manage to take a loan out in somebody else’s name?</p><p>Well, if you’re conducting financial transactions on any platform, including Dhani, then RBI mandates that the company verify your identity. Hence the name — Know Your Customer (or KYC).</p><p>However, there are <a href=\"https://the-ken.com/story/the-ghost-loans-haunting-indian-fintechs-like-dhani/\" rel=\"noopener\">many ways</a> they could go about doing this</p><ol><li>For starters, they could do an in-person verification. Make sure that the documents are in order and your ID proof backs up your claim.</li><li>Do a video verification. Kind of similar, but they’re asking you to record a video with your ID proof.</li><li>Use documents to independently verify your identity without actually seeing you in person or video.</li></ol><p>And as a report in The Ken <a href=\"https://the-ken.com/story/the-ghost-loans-haunting-indian-fintechs-like-dhani/\" rel=\"noopener\">notes</a> — In-person and video verification can be expensive. It can also be time-consuming. So most companies that dole out loans simply rely on documents uploaded by the user.</p><p>Here’s how that would work.</p><p>First, they’ll verify to see that the PAN card you upload, tallies with the information available on the government’s website. They want to make sure that you aren’t making it all up.</p><p>Then they’ll look at your ID proof — Say your Aadhar Card and tally it with information on the government’s database  once again— Make sure the names, pictures and the address match.</p><p>Finally, they’ll seek information about your bank account. This allows them to check if you are in fact the person that holds the account. </p><p>And if everything checks out, they may choose to disburse the loan. However, rarely  does everything check out. Oftentimes, pictures are smudgy, names don’t match, addresses have discrepancies. And companies will have to rely on their own internal assessment to verify if the applicant is genuine. But if the internal assessment tools aren’t quite robust or in this case extremely lax, then malicious agents can use forged records and fake identity proofs to pass off as someone else.</p><p>In fact, from the looks of it, most cases of identity theft reported during this saga don’t seem to be all that sophisticated.

INSANE. Some idiot used my Pan to take a 2000 RS loan and FCK’d my CIBIL score and @IVLSecurities did nothing to help sort. HOW DOES INDIA BULLS ALLOW THIS @ibhomeloans @CIBIL_Official”</em></p><p>That was a <a href=\"https://theprint.in/india/actor-sunny-leone-claims-identity-theft-pan-details-allegedly-used-for-fintech-loan-fraud/835110/#google_vignette\" rel=\"noopener\">tweet</a> from Sunny Leone (later deleted) posted on the 17th of February</p><p>Wait, why are we talking about Sunny Leone?</p><p>Well, in case you haven’t heard, a loan fraud is doing the rounds in India. And it’s wreaking havoc on credit scores. It has all the markings of identity theft. You know when some dubious individual gets his hands on an unsuspecting person’s unique identity number and then uses the information to commit financial frauds.</p><p>For instance, take Sunny Leone’s case. Someone used her identity, took out a loan of about ₹2,000 and then defaulted on payments. When you default on payments your credit score goes for a toss. And that can impact so many things. Banks may refuse to dole out new loans. You may be asked to pay a higher interest rate. And you may even have trouble getting your hands on a credit card.</p><p>For what?</p><p>For something, you didn’t even do. It’s crazy, right? Anyway, it wasn’t just Sunny Leone. Reuters tech journalist Aditya Kalra <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adityakalra/status/1492897511052242946\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeted</a> about something similar. And on 14th February, communications consultant Karthik Srinivasan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beastoftraal/status/1494250241402441734\" rel=\"noopener\">followed</a> it up with his experience. Soon enough, this kicked up a storm on Twitter with so many people sharing similar stories.</p><p>And the entity that’s in the midst of this brouhaha? Dhani Loans and Services Ltd.</p><p>In case the name Dhani doesn’t ring a bell, maybe you know them by another name — Indiabulls. Yeah, they’re part of the Indiabulls Group — who have quite the presence in the real estate and housing loan markets. And Dhani — earlier called Indiabulls Consumer Finance doles out consumer loans.</p><p>But how did this happen?</p><p>How did fraudsters manage to take a loan out in somebody else’s name?</p><p>Well, if you’re conducting financial transactions on any platform, including Dhani, then RBI mandates that the company verify your identity. Hence the name — Know Your Customer (or KYC).</p><p>However, there are <a href=\"https://the-ken.com/story/the-ghost-loans-haunting-indian-fintechs-like-dhani/\" rel=\"noopener\">many ways</a> they could go about doing this</p><ol><li>For starters, they could do an in-person verification. Make sure that the documents are in order and your ID proof backs up your claim.</li><li>Do a video verification. Kind of similar, but they’re asking you to record a video with your ID proof.</li><li>Use documents to independently verify your identity without actually seeing you in person or video.</li></ol><p>And as a report in The Ken <a href=\"https://the-ken.com/story/the-ghost-loans-haunting-indian-fintechs-like-dhani/\" rel=\"noopener\">notes</a> — In-person and video verification can be expensive. It can also be time-consuming. So most companies that dole out loans simply rely on documents uploaded by the user.</p><p>Here’s how that would work.</p><p>First, they’ll verify to see that the PAN card you upload, tallies with the information available on the government’s website. They want to make sure that you aren’t making it all up.</p><p>Then they’ll look at your ID proof — Say your Aadhar Card and tally it with information on the government’s database  once again— Make sure the names, pictures and the address match.</p><p>Finally, they’ll seek information about your bank account. This allows them to check if you are in fact the person that holds the account. </p><p>And if everything checks out, they may choose to disburse the loan. However, rarely  does everything check out. Oftentimes, pictures are smudgy, names don’t match, addresses have discrepancies. And companies will have to rely on their own internal assessment to verify if the applicant is genuine. But if the internal assessment tools aren’t quite robust or in this case extremely lax, then malicious agents can use forged records and fake identity proofs to pass off as someone else.</p><p>In fact, from the looks of it, most cases of identity theft reported during this saga don’t seem to be all that sophisticated. Half baked names and photoshopped PAN cards seem to have done the trick. Which does beg the question — Are fintechs doing enough to prevent all this?</p><p>Are they rigorously combing through these documents?</p><p>Well, Dhani for its part has stated that they are pursuing criminal action against the perpetrators and tightening their KYC process. They’ve also promised to deal with customer queries, although many people still seem to be waiting on a resolution.</p><p>But that aside, these developments should worry everyone considering India has suffered more data breaches than most countries in 2021.

So we won’t talk about the implications of a full-blown war between Russia and Ukraine. Instead, we will pursue the economic angle, as we always do*.</p><p>But if you want a brief on the crisis, here it is —</p><p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, East European countries including the likes of Estonia, Poland and the Czech Republic, moved away from Russia’s Sphere of Influence and joined NATO. NATO happens to be a military alliance of several European and North American countries. The alliance is particularly formidable considering “<em>an armed attack on one or more of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America.”</em></p><p>So everybody retaliates.</p><p>And as NATO’s influence spread across East Europe, Russia found itself in an increasingly precarious position. Or as Vladimir Putin puts it — <em>“ You promised us in the 1990s that [NATO] would not move an inch to the East. You cheated us shamelessly.”</em></p><p>Needless to say, after putting up with this “provocation” for so long, he now wants NATO to walk back — Remove the missiles and the defence systems stationed in East European countries and halt further expansion. Most notably, he doesn’t want NATO to welcome Ukraine to its fold — a country that borders Russia. NATO meanwhile doesn’t want to cede to these requests considering they believe any sovereign country should have the right to decide its own fate — including Ukraine.</p><p>So there was an impasse. An impasse that political leaders tried to resolve.</p><p>But alas, talks didn’t help. Diplomatic solutions couldn’t bear fruit. And tensions peaked as Russian President Vladimir Putin increasingly ramped up his rhetoric against Ukraine. At one point he even questioned its statehood — Asserting that Russia created Ukraine. What’s worse? He has also recognised the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk — two cities in Ukraine, partly controlled by Russian backed separatists and partly controlled by the Ukrainian government.</p><p>Political analysts now believe that Putin may have set the stage for a full-scale invasion of Eastern Ukraine. He may even choose to invade the whole country, but considering the human and economic cost involved, that proposition does seem a bit unlikely — at least for now.</p><p>So there’s the status quo.</p><p>And while Western leaders have condemned Putin’s actions so far, they aren't willing to send in their own troops to fight on Ukraine’s behalf. Instead, they've promised to pursue sanctions. Sanctions that will likely deal a crippling blow to Russia’s economy.</p><p>But before we deal with that, let’s talk about the war itself. The cost of war is steep. Russia won’t just pay for supplies and operations today. They will have to do so in perpetuity.</p><p>Take, for instance, the US war on terror. Their government committed close to <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2018/Crawford_Costs%20of%20War%20Estimates%20Through%20FY2019.pdf\">$6 Trillion dollars</a> on post-war efforts since 9/11. This includes all the money spent mobilising resources in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and all future obligations that accrue out of such war efforts — including interest costs (on borrowed money) and post-war care for veterans. And if Russia’s objective here is to invade people who aren’t sympathetic to their cause, then the costs will only add up.</p><p>Second, Russia will also have to deal with the sanctions. Think of sanctions as financial restrictions imposed on Russia and agents operating out of Russia. For instance, the European Union and the US are likely to impose heavy restrictions on Russia’s ability to borrow from investors in Europe. Without borrowed money, it can become extremely hard to wage a prolonged military campaign. The US will also impose similar sanctions and ban key Russian businessmen from the country. They’ll freeze their assets and target businesses in Russia — Making it hard for them to operate across the world.</p><p>But here’s something interesting. These measures won’t just hurt Russia. There will also be some collateral damage back in the US and the European Union. Take, for instance, the sanctions imposed on Rusal (Russian aluminium giant) back in 2018. After only a few months, the US had to roll back sanctions because of the unexpected fallout in the aluminium market.</p><p>As a Reuters report notes —</p><blockquote><em>U.S. sanctions on Rusal imposed in April 2018 — and lifted in early 2019 — created major disruption for firms in the transport, construction and packaging industries. The resulting scramble for aluminium saw prices jump 30% in just a few days.</em></blockquote><p>And this isn’t a one-off either. Right now Germany has decided to halt the final approval to operate Nord Stream 2 — a 1,200 km pipeline running under the Baltic sea— transporting natural gas from Russia to Germany. The pipeline is ready. Gazprom has invested about €5 bn and the likes of Shell and ENGIE (oil and gas companies in the West) have put up the rest. All they need is the go-ahead — a final seal of approval to transport natural gas from Russia to the European Union. However, with the sanctions in place, that may not happen. And if it doesn’t happen, Europe will have to source gas from elsewhere, which will likely lift oil prices for everyone.</p><p>A sudden rise in oil prices could affect multiple industries. Prices could soar and inflation could become a key concern — not just in Russia, the US and the EU, but everywhere. And this should probably explain why the markets have been jittery. This isn’t an isolated event. This affects all of us.</p><p>And finally, one other thing. We talked about Nord Stream 2, but what about other pipelines? Isn't Russia already pumping gas to the European Union?</p><p>Yes they are. And it's business as usual on this front. The only difference — some of these older pipelines run through land — Russian land, Ukrainian land and German land. And Ukraine doesn’t want any disruptions here. If anything they're worried that the Nord Stream 2 may reduce Russia's dependence on Ukrainian co-operation. </p><p>And that brings us to today. </p><p>*It should be evident by now that this crisis isn’t just about geo-politics. It’s about economics, money and shared financial interests. But like most things, economics is a fleeting enterprise. You make some money today. You lose some tomorrow. But the human costs will be immeasurable. You can't just look past the bloodshed and the misery this war will beckon if Russia chooses to invade Ukraine and subjugate its people. People who by the way have no role to play in any of this. Ukraine isn't allied with NATO yet. And despite Russia's repeated assertions, they haven't been the aggressors.

But today those dreams lay in tatters. They aren’t making good progress on domains such as AI research, operating systems and aircraft manufacturing and it doesn’t appear as if they have a wide enough pool of specialised talent to make headway anytime soon either. All in all, China is grasping at straws here and may find themselves left behind as the US keeps gaining ground on breakthrough tech that could come to shape the future.</p><p>Who says this?</p><p>Not America, not India, not Finshots. Instead, the rather unpleasant truth comes from no less than China itself.</p><p>That’s right China!</p><p>A few weeks ago, one of China’s most respected think tanks — the Institute of International and Strategic Studies (IISS) at Peking University — published a damning report titled “China-US Strategic Competition in Technology: Analysis and Prospects”.</p><p>Their main contention — As China and US grow distant, both countries are likely to lose. But China may be the ultimate losers here since they have more at stake. Now you may already know that the US has been cracking down on Chinese tech quite heavily. First, they placed a ban on a string of Chinese companies from receiving US capital and supplies. Then they placed export restrictions on Chinese companies operating in the US. They were also tacitly discouraging all Chinese-US scientific cooperation fearing espionage. And relations between the two countries are at an all-time low.</p><p>So the think tank’s admission shouldn’t come as a shocker. In fact, China has long been wary of losing the tech battle with the US. The same think tank had previously indicated that a “targeted decoupling of supply chains” was one of the<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-state-think-tank-sees-093000608.html\" rel=\"noopener\"> top 10 global risks</a> China is likely to face in 2022, along with mutations of the Covid-19 virus.</p><p>Targeted decoupling of supply chains is a fancy word to explain what we talked about earlier — the end of economic engagement. However, this recent academic introspection is slightly different in its approach since the report lays bare China’s less than satisfactory progress in developing key technologies at home.</p><p>In other words, the difficulties of being truly Atmanirbhar. </p><p>For instance, the country is struggling to make inroads in the development of operating systems. According to The Economist, Chinese companies have invested around <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2022/02/19/china-wants-to-insulate-itself-against-western-sanctions\" rel=\"noopener\">$4 billion</a> between 2019 and 2021 to develop alternatives to US operating systems like Android and Apple’s iOS. Huawei a Chinese phone manufacturer — cut off from accessing chips and software back in America, felt a particular need to develop an alternative. The end result? A domestically developed OS called “HarmonyOS” (also known as “HongmengOS” in China). The OS was touted as the next big rival to Android.

      "<p><em>In today's Finshots we talk about a report detailing China's losing battle with the US</em></p><p><em>Also, one more thing tax season is just round the corner. And if you need good insurance advice, you know who to call, right?</em></p><p><em><a href=\"https://bit.ly/30TTy78\">Ditto</a>  - Talk to us</em></p><p><em>Alright, on with the story now. </em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr/><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h3 id=\"the-story\">The Story</h3><p>China is slowly losing the tech war.</p><p>It once wanted to usurp the US and claim technological superiority. But today those dreams lay in tatters. They aren’t making good progress on domains such as AI research, operating systems and aircraft manufacturing and it doesn’t appear as if they have a wide enough pool of specialised talent to make headway anytime soon either. All in all, China is grasping at straws here and may find themselves left behind as the US keeps gaining ground on breakthrough tech that could come to shape the future.</p><p>Who says this?</p><p>Not America, not India, not Finshots. Instead, the rather unpleasant truth comes from no less than China itself.</p><p>That’s right China!</p><p>A few weeks ago, one of China’s most respected think tanks — the Institute of International and Strategic Studies (IISS) at Peking University — published a damning report titled “China-US Strategic Competition in Technology: Analysis and Prospects”.</p><p>Their main contention — As China and US grow distant, both countries are likely to lose. But China may be the ultimate losers here since they have more at stake. Now you may already know that the US has been cracking down on Chinese tech quite heavily. First, they placed a ban on a string of Chinese companies from receiving US capital and supplies. Then they placed export restrictions on Chinese companies operating in the US. They were also tacitly discouraging all Chinese-US scientific cooperation fearing espionage. And relations between the two countries are at an all-time low.</p><p>So the think tank’s admission shouldn’t come as a shocker. In fact, China has long been wary of losing the tech battle with the US. The same think tank had previously indicated that a “targeted decoupling of supply chains” was one of the<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-state-think-tank-sees-093000608.html\" rel=\"noopener\"> top 10 global risks</a> China is likely to face in 2022, along with mutations of the Covid-19 virus.</p><p>Targeted decoupling of supply chains is a fancy word to explain what we talked about earlier — the end of economic engagement. However, this recent academic introspection is slightly different in its approach since the report lays bare China’s less than satisfactory progress in developing key technologies at home.</p><p>In other words, the difficulties of being truly Atmanirbhar. </p><p>For instance, the country is struggling to make inroads in the development of operating systems. According to The Economist, Chinese companies have invested around <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2022/02/19/china-wants-to-insulate-itself-against-western-sanctions\" rel=\"noopener\">$4 billion</a> between 2019 and 2021 to develop alternatives to US operating systems like Android and Apple’s iOS. Huawei a Chinese phone manufacturer — cut off from accessing chips and software back in America, felt a particular need to develop an alternative. The end result? A domestically developed OS called “HarmonyOS” (also known as “HongmengOS” in China). The OS was touted as the next big rival to Android. Except, anyone who ever used HarmonyOS calls it the ‘<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/huaweis-harmonyos-will-rollout-to-100-android-models-over-the-next-year/#:~:text=Yesterday%2C%20it%20was%20shipping%20phones,forked%20Android%20without%20Google%20services.\" rel=\"noopener\">forked Android version without Google services</a>’ or ‘<a href=\"https://www.extremetech.com/mobile/319739-it-turns-out-huaweis-harmonyos-is-still-just-android\" rel=\"noopener\">Android with a new skin</a>’.

Now consumers rarely ever interact with the NSE, since your stockbroker does it for you. But in the grand scheme of things, the stock exchange is where the magic happens.</p><p>But NSE wasn’t always this powerful. It wasn’t even the biggest stock exchange in India. That title belonged to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). However, since the time BSE was set up in 1875, it was largely run by a coterie of brokers who prioritized their interests above all else. They pretty much set the rules and investors and companies were mere pawns in this enterprise.</p><p>But then came the mother of all scandals in 1992. A man named Harshad Mehta found loopholes in the banking system and funnelled a boatload of money to buy and inflate stock prices. And since there was little oversight here, the markets crashed and people suffered in tandem. The government had to do something. They had to make stock exchanges more accountable.</p><p>So, they asked the state-owned Industrial and Development Bank of India (IDBI) to help set up a stock exchange that could compete with BSE—Give them something to think about. The idea was to instil a professional management team and digitize everything—Move from paper to electronic share trading. And it worked.</p><p>NSE thrived, while BSE lost market share.

And despite denying any wrongdoing, both NSE and Chitra Ramkrishna were fined by SEBI.</p><p>Now here’s where things start taking a turn.

He was the puppet master. And Chitra Ramkrishna fell prey to a petty scam. That’s all there is to it. Backing this theory—Your very own NSE.</p><p>Theory 4: There is a Yogi. He isn’t faceless. He isn’t nameless. He is quietly operating in the background. And he was the one who coordinated the entire scheme.

      "<p>Hello again! <br/><br/>Did you have a good week? More importantly, did you take some time out to write down your goals?  I know some of you did because you emailed to tell us about them! Anand told us about his long-term goal of setting up a school and Tanvi even sent us a picture she drew of the house she wants to live in. Such lovely stuff.<br/><br/>We love receiving such emails so keep ‘em coming at <a href=\"mailto:money@finshots.in\">money@finshots.in</a>!</p><p>But it’s also okay if you were caught up last week and didn’t get the time to do it. Maybe we can do it now? Because having it all written down is going to help you when we crunch some numbers today and draw up a basic financial plan. We’re going to find out a little about taking risks and how much we need to invest towards our goals. And that means, there’s another <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13LUIThaOS_QLXAtQz4gxEA7v5UaZQsp3/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=101054593422911801730&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true\">special spreadsheet </a>we’re giving you too! :)</p><p>Before we jump in, here's a quick look at what we've covered so far: <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/your-finshots-money-resolutions-start-now/\">Week 1</a> (habits), <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/finshots-money-resolution-2-budget-you-bff/\">Week 2</a> (budget), <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/finshots-money-resolution-3-breaking-the-income-barrier/\">Week 3</a> (income), <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/finshots-money-resolution-4-axe-your-tax/\">Week 4 </a>(taxes), <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/finshots-money-resolution-5-buy-protection/\">Week 5</a> (insurance), <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/setting-goals/\">Week 6</a> (goal setting).</p><p><strong>How long will the exercise take? 🕰️</strong><br/><br/>45 minutes. That’s it.<br/><br/>Do it before your next meal? Because we all know what happens after a heavy weekend meal. ;)</p><p><strong>Ready? Let’s begin Resolution #7! </strong><br/><br/>Let me give you a fair warning. If you get overwhelmed by large numbers, ask your best friend, partner, or family member to join you in on the exercise. It’ll be nice to have someone your trust join in this journey too. </p><p>Alright then. Have you got that spreadsheet or piece of paper where you’ve written all your goals? Brilliant. <br/><br/><strong>Step 1: Understanding risk</strong><br/><br/>There are lots of different kinds of risks and we could have an entire Resolution for understanding risk. But for the purposes of a financial plan, the biggest risk is that we don’t meet our goals! <br/><br/>And that can happen in two ways. <br/><br/>Firstly, we set unrealistic expectations. For instance, we set a goal of buying a car that’s worth ₹15 lakhs. We want to buy it in 5 years. So we do a quick calculation to figure out how much we need to invest every month to amass that sum of money. And we find that it’s ₹11,000 monthly. So you begin saving up. And 5 years later, we find that we only have ₹8.50 lakhs. Why did that happen? Because we assumed that we’d make an unreasonably high return of 20% per year. If we’d assumed a more reasonable return of 10%, we would’ve realised we actually need to invest ₹19,000 a month. So remember, the stocks or cryptos are not going to provide a high return just because we need it to. They have a mind of their own. So our expectations have to be realistic.<br/><br/>The other kind of risk is that we don’t take any risk at all. Let me explain. We put all our money in savings bank accounts or fixed deposits. And we don’t realise that inflation is screwing us over. The house we want to buy might cost ₹50 lakhs today. But it could cost nearly ₹1 crore in just 10 years from now. If we don’t take a bit of risk, our money won’t grow. And we won’t have enough money to achieve our goals. <br/><br/>As you can see, taking the right amount of risk is crucial for our financial plan. </p><p><strong>Step 2: How much money do you need to invest?</strong><br/><br/>This is the tricky part. But fret not, this is where <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13LUIThaOS_QLXAtQz4gxEA7v5UaZQsp3/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=101054593422911801730&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true\">our spreadsheet</a> will swing into action like your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman!<br/><br/>The only thing you have to do is list out your goals. Then write down how much money you’re going to need for it and choose the kind of risk you’re comfortable with. We’ll take inflation into account and everything. <br/><br/>Okay, setting values for most goals is easy. For instance, you just need to figure out how much your dream home costs today. And then we’ll sort of inflate that value into the future. For when you actually want to buy it.<br/><br/>But how on earth do you calculate what’s needed for retirement? Well, we’re ditching the complex calculations in the spreadsheet and we’ve used a simple thumb rule to help you understand this. Oh, and don’t freak out. Retirement numbers can look daunting. <br/><br/>Just trust the spreadsheet<br/><br/><strong>Step 3: What investments work for your goals?</strong><br/><br/>You’ve already listed out your financial goals and the year in which you want to achieve them, right?<br/><br/>Now club them together. </p><ol><li>Goals that you want to achieve within 5 years</li><li>Goals within 5-10 years</li><li>Goals beyond 10 years</li></ol><p>Done?<br/><br/>For the goals that you want to hit within 5 years, you may not want to take on any risk at all. Stick to safety. It could be invested in things like debt mutual funds (we’ll explain a little more about these next week). Because protecting your money is the number one priority. Not to maximise returns.<br/><br/>If your goals are within 5-10 years, you could take a bit of risk. Some part of your investments could go into equity mutual funds that buy stocks.  This way, you’re giving your money a chance to grow. And since you have a bit more time on your hands, the ups and downs in the stock market won’t hurt you too much. The other part of the money could go towards debt mutual funds. That way, you get some stability too.<br/><br/>For goals beyond 10 years, we can afford to take a bit more risk. More equity based investments perhaps. Give your money the best chance to grow.<br/><br/>Also, remember when you set goals that are for your family’s future, you need to protect those goals too. How? Life insurance, of course. If you need help in figuring out what’s an appropriate cover, you can reach out to my colleagues at <a href=\"https://joinditto.in/\">Ditto Insurance</a>! And I can promise that no one will spam you.<br/><br/><strong>Step 5:</strong> <strong>Review your financial goals every year</strong><br/><br/>5 years ago, you might have been happy with a hatchback. But times have changed and you now want an SUV with all the bells and whistles. That’s okay. As long you’re aware of why the goal has changed and whether it’s a realistic goal for you to achieve. So make sure you’re reviewing your goal sheet at least once a year.<br/><br/>And the closer you get to your goal, the less risky should be the investment tied to the goal. Let’s take buying a home in 10 years for instance. Say you’ve been investing 100% of your monies meant for this goal in equity mutual funds. And you’ve been doing this for 6-7 years. The goal is just another 3 years away now. So you can’t have all the money tied into riskier investments. You need to start protecting the money you’ve built. So, as you get close to the goal, you need to move it into more stable investments like a debt mutual fund or a bank deposit. Protect it.<br/><br/>In case you missed the link to the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13LUIThaOS_QLXAtQz4gxEA7v5UaZQsp3/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=101054593422911801730&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true\">Finshots Money Goal-based spreadsheet, here it is.</a><br/><br/><strong>A secret for you 🤐</strong><br/><br/>If you’ve got started on the Finshots Money Resolutions, don’t stop now!

The goal is just another 3 years away now. So you can’t have all the money tied into riskier investments. You need to start protecting the money you’ve built. So, as you get close to the goal, you need to move it into more stable investments like a debt mutual fund or a bank deposit. Protect it.<br/><br/>In case you missed the link to the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13LUIThaOS_QLXAtQz4gxEA7v5UaZQsp3/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=101054593422911801730&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true\">Finshots Money Goal-based spreadsheet, here it is.</a><br/><br/><strong>A secret for you 🤐</strong><br/><br/>If you’ve got started on the Finshots Money Resolutions, don’t stop now!

They collect money (premiums) from clients and promise to offer future monetary benefits in exchange. Once they collect these premiums, they invest these monies in stocks, bonds and other financial instruments according to guidelines prescribed by the regulator. And they can do all this thanks to the 1.35 million individual agents that scour the country looking to insure every Indian possible.</p><p>No doubt this offers them considerable leverage.</p><p>They are the biggest insurance company in India and the 5th largest insurer in the world. They sell 3 out of 4 life insurance policies in the country. They manage assets to the tune of ₹39 lakh crores. In effect, they’re managing more money than the entire mutual fund industry combined. They own 4% of all stocks listed on the Indian stock market and they’re sitting on unrealised gains to the tune of ₹4 lakh crores. They hold more government bonds than the RBI. And according to one UBS report, about 10% of all household savings go to LIC each year. Even the State Bank of India can’t solicit this kind of funds from the general public.</p><p>LIC is a behemoth.</p><p>A behemoth like no other.</p><p><strong>Future Prospects</strong></p><p>Having said that, investors seldom care about past glory. They’ll want to keep an eye on future growth prospects and it’s the only reason why they’d pay up for LIC's shares.</p><p>But alas, here we see a few cracks opening up. There’s a marked slowdown on the horizon. Growth in new business premiums is lacklustre and they continue to cede market share to private life insurers. Now LIC will claim that this could be attributed to Covid induced disruptions. They’ll argue that their agents couldn’t spend as much time in the field these past two years and this has had an impact on generating new business. But even if you did account for this anomaly, you’ll see that growth isn’t like it used to be. Especially in urban areas. And this isn’t great news.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://cdn.finshots.app/images/2022/02/growth-in-premiums.jpg\"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Also, LIC primarily markets insurance products that aren’t particularly lucrative. And this can be problematic depending on what side of the aisle you’re on.</p><p>Let us explain.</p><p>When you think of insurance, you’re probably thinking of pure protection products i.e. If there’s a death or a hospitalization, the insurance company pays up. Nothing more, Nothing less. But LIC doesn’t sell these products. At least that’s not where they make most of their money. Instead, they sell policies that could be best described as part insurance, part investment products.</p><p>Effectively every time you pay a premium, a small chunk of it will be set aside to offer you death cover (decent payout in case you do die). And the remaining funds are invested across stocks and bonds, the way we described earlier. In this case, death isn’t a necessary condition for the policyholder to gain from this arrangement. They’ll still get some money back after the policy expires and this seeming benefit makes these insurance products extremely attractive to the layperson.</p><p>You don’t even need to market it aggressively. The product sells itself.</p><p>However, despite the apparent appeal, the margins on these products aren’t great. It’s the pure protection products that are lucrative. So while private life insurers continue to focus on the latter, LIC is still sticking to its guns. Which may not be a problem right now, but could become a bit of an issue as the Indian market matures.</p><p>There’s also the fact that LIC ploughs a lot of its surplus back to policyholders each year. This they’re expected to do because they sell a good chunk of what we call participating products — Where customers are entitled to some of LIC’s profits in addition to other policy benefits. However, for shareholders looking to corner a larger part of the surplus, this may not look very enticing. They like non-participating products better— Where customers only get a fixed benefit and no share in the profits. So if you’re buying into LIC's promise that’s something you’ll have to keep an eye on as well — the share of participating vs non-participating policies.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://cdn.finshots.app/images/2022/02/grajh.png\"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><strong>Valuation</strong></p><p>Now usually we don’t do valuations. Because it isn’t a particularly fruitful exercise. But in this case, we feel compelled to touch upon the subject because insurance isn’t like other businesses at all. It’s a totally different ballgame. LIC collects money upfront and then promises to compensate policyholders sometime in the future. The premiums they collect cannot be recognised as revenue and you can’t just expense the figure to derive P&amp;L numbers. It just doesn’t work that way.</p><p>Instead, analysts use a figure called the Embedded Value. Think of it as a number that encapsulates the present value of all future profits expected from policies sold and funds accumulated over the years that explicitly belong to shareholders. With Embedded value, you can get a ballpark figure of what the company is actually worth today.</p><p>What’s the EV for LIC?</p><p>Well, as of 30 September 2021, the Embedded Value was pegged at a whopping ₹5.4 Lakh crores. </p><p>Wow!!!</p><p>But bear in mind, that’s the value of the company right now. LIC will go on to sell more policies in the future. They’ll collect more premiums, make more money and redistribute it to shareholders. And if you account for this growth, you’ll see that LIC should be valued higher than the ₹5 lakh crore figure we quoted.</p><p>How high?</p><p>Analysts originally pegged it to be in the range of ₹13–14 lakh crores. However, the government has had an epiphany it seems and it has since trimmed the valuation. They are now seeking a value of a mere ₹6 lakh crores. That’s not too far off the embedded value.</p><p>With that being said however, when LIC puts up 3.5% of its company for sale, it will suck nearly 21,000 crores out of the ecosystem, if the IPO were fully subscribed. The government is going to make nearly 3 billion dollars from this. And that’s not spare change.</p><blockquote><em>Point of Interest: The Embedded value has seen a sharp uptick this year thanks to a structural change in LICs Life fund, that let's shareholders enjoy a higher share in the proceeds.

      "<p><em>In today's Finshots we talk about Disney's latest foray into real estate</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr/><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h3 id=\"the-story\">The Story</h3><p>What’s the first thing you think of when you see the word, Disney?</p><p>Mickey Mouse? Marvel? Star Wars or maybe some other Disney character that shaped your childhood. But unlike its contemporaries, Disney’s magic isn’t just limited to cinemas or TV alone. Instead, it transcends those conventional mediums.</p><p>You can “experience” the Disney fairytale first-hand in  dozens of elaborate theme parks across the globe. To this date, they register millions of visitors each year. Last quarter alone, its parks division posted a sweet<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/02/09/disneys-theme-parks-lift-earnings-as-company-beats-q1-expectations/\" rel=\"noopener\"> $7.2 billion</a> in revenues. So clearly, there are enough people in the world who prefer to love, live and breathe everything “Disney.”</p><p>Which explains Disney’s latest venture — “Storyliving by Disney”.</p><p>What’s that?</p><p>Well, to put it simply, it’s Disney’s attempt to sell premium real estate in the name of… um…. Disney.</p><p>Yeah!!!</p><p>This Wednesday the company<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-to-develop-residential-communities-11645025886\" rel=\"noopener\"> unveiled</a> that it was going to build several residential townships across the US. Except, unlike its popular theme parks, these townships won’t feature its famous rides or Mickey Mouse mascots roaming around the streets. Instead, you will find meticulously manicured villas, condos, shopping and entertainment centres, all sprinkled with subtle Disney themes. The community itself will be managed and maintained by Disney’s guest services, the very people who manage those parks.</p><p>The first-ever Storyliving neighbourhood — a 618-acre community called Cotino — is already under construction in Rancho Mirage, California. It comes with its own 24-acre “grand oasis” lagoon, smack in the middle of the town.</p><p>Enticing prospect for all the Disney adults out there, isn’t it?</p><p>Well, true. But this isn’t the first time Disney is painting a pristine picture. It has dabbled in real estate before and the results weren’t exactly stellar.</p><p>Disney’s experiments with real estate began with its illustrious founder. Walt Disney was fascinated by urban development and city planning. He was also not a particular fan of what modern cities offered in his time. He thought they were disorganized, dirty and unliveable in general. He vowed to change that and dreamed of building a futuristic city of his own. A city that had no place for laborious commute, dirty streets, and failing infrastructure. Instead, he wanted it to feature neatly lined houses, a string of monorails and something called the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FedTrm3g38\" rel=\"noopener\">PeopleMover</a> — a means of transport that always keeps moving — to help people get around.</p><p>He called the city<a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/news/a35104/walt-disney-epcot-history-city-of-tomorrow/\" rel=\"noopener\"> EPCOT</a> — the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. By the mid-1960s, Walt had redirected considerable resources to make EPCOT a reality. Unfortunately, Disney died in 1966 and his vision died with him. The company subsequently shelved the ambitious plans for EPCOT and converted what was to be “EPCOT the city” into “EPCOT the theme park”, which operates even today. The company also later utilized many of the elements developed during this time and incorporated them inside the parks, including the PeopleMover.</p><p>But the idea of building a liveable space? It was still something they wanted to take a shot at. And in 1996, Disney revisited those plans once again and launched Celebration, a new planned town near its Orlando resort that could house a population of around 10,000. The residents of the town for years complained about the poor quality of construction. The town was also subject to widespread foreclosures post-2008 recession. Some residents even described the experience as “creepy.” It simply didn’t have the Disney magic and instead, it was a “<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/celebration-florida-the-utopian-town-that-america-jus-1564479405\" rel=\"noopener\">nightmare</a>” of sorts.</p><p>The company eventually sold much of its stake in 2004 to a private investment firm. But that’s not it.</p><p>In 2011, Disney took another shot at real estate by building a 980-acre gated Golden Oak community in Florida located right beside Walt Disney World. And unlike the previous attempts, this was somewhat of a success.

      "<p><em>In today's Finshots we talk about Disney's latest foray into real estate</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr/><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h3 id=\"the-story\">The Story</h3><p>What’s the first thing you think of when you see the word, Disney?</p><p>Mickey Mouse? Marvel? Star Wars or maybe some other Disney character that shaped your childhood. But unlike its contemporaries, Disney’s magic isn’t just limited to cinemas or TV alone. Instead, it transcends those conventional mediums.</p><p>You can “experience” the Disney fairytale first-hand in  dozens of elaborate theme parks across the globe. To this date, they register millions of visitors each year. Last quarter alone, its parks division posted a sweet<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/02/09/disneys-theme-parks-lift-earnings-as-company-beats-q1-expectations/\" rel=\"noopener\"> $7.2 billion</a> in revenues. So clearly, there are enough people in the world who prefer to love, live and breathe everything “Disney.”</p><p>Which explains Disney’s latest venture — “Storyliving by Disney”.</p><p>What’s that?</p><p>Well, to put it simply, it’s Disney’s attempt to sell premium real estate in the name of… um…. Disney.</p><p>Yeah!!!</p><p>This Wednesday the company<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-to-develop-residential-communities-11645025886\" rel=\"noopener\"> unveiled</a> that it was going to build several residential townships across the US. Except, unlike its popular theme parks, these townships won’t feature its famous rides or Mickey Mouse mascots roaming around the streets. Instead, you will find meticulously manicured villas, condos, shopping and entertainment centres, all sprinkled with subtle Disney themes. The community itself will be managed and maintained by Disney’s guest services, the very people who manage those parks.</p><p>The first-ever Storyliving neighbourhood — a 618-acre community called Cotino — is already under construction in Rancho Mirage, California. It comes with its own 24-acre “grand oasis” lagoon, smack in the middle of the town.</p><p>Enticing prospect for all the Disney adults out there, isn’t it?</p><p>Well, true. But this isn’t the first time Disney is painting a pristine picture. It has dabbled in real estate before and the results weren’t exactly stellar.</p><p>Disney’s experiments with real estate began with its illustrious founder. Walt Disney was fascinated by urban development and city planning. He was also not a particular fan of what modern cities offered in his time. He thought they were disorganized, dirty and unliveable in general. He vowed to change that and dreamed of building a futuristic city of his own. A city that had no place for laborious commute, dirty streets, and failing infrastructure. Instead, he wanted it to feature neatly lined houses, a string of monorails and something called the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FedTrm3g38\" rel=\"noopener\">PeopleMover</a> — a means of transport that always keeps moving — to help people get around.</p><p>He called the city<a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/news/a35104/walt-disney-epcot-history-city-of-tomorrow/\" rel=\"noopener\"> EPCOT</a> — the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. By the mid-1960s, Walt had redirected considerable resources to make EPCOT a reality. Unfortunately, Disney died in 1966 and his vision died with him. The company subsequently shelved the ambitious plans for EPCOT and converted what was to be “EPCOT the city” into “EPCOT the theme park”, which operates even today. The company also later utilized many of the elements developed during this time and incorporated them inside the parks, including the PeopleMover.</p><p>But the idea of building a liveable space? It was still something they wanted to take a shot at. And in 1996, Disney revisited those plans once again and launched Celebration, a new planned town near its Orlando resort that could house a population of around 10,000. The residents of the town for years complained about the poor quality of construction. The town was also subject to widespread foreclosures post-2008 recession. Some residents even described the experience as “creepy.” It simply didn’t have the Disney magic and instead, it was a “<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/celebration-florida-the-utopian-town-that-america-jus-1564479405\" rel=\"noopener\">nightmare</a>” of sorts.</p><p>The company eventually sold much of its stake in 2004 to a private investment firm. But that’s not it.</p><p>In 2011, Disney took another shot at real estate by building a 980-acre gated Golden Oak community in Florida located right beside Walt Disney World. And unlike the previous attempts, this was somewhat of a success. Because vacation homes in Golden Oak still sell for as high as anywhere between $1.5 million and $10 million.</p><p>So yeah, real estate may not have been Disney’s cup of tea. But they finally seem to be getting a hang of things.</p><p>Until next time…</p><p><em>Don't forget to share this article on <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An%20explainer%20on%20Disney's%20foray%20into%20real%20estate%20https://bit.ly/3gW4khA\">WhatsApp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/you-can-now-stay-in-disneyland-forever\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/3I5VxWA&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An%20explainer%20on%20Disney's%20foray%20into%20real%20estate\">Twitter</a></em></p><p><em>Also, at Finshots we have strived to keep the newsletter free for everyone.

They can beam the internet right from the sky and reach most places on earth. All you need are some satellites in space, a pizza-sized dish antenna, a tripod, and a Wi-Fi router to go with it.

This disparity is most obvious when you look at the hinterlands. Internet access is lacklustre, patchy or non-existent in most rural areas. And we seem to have a lot of those. Second, it also helps that making and launching satellites into space isn’t as expensive as it used to be. In fact, if anything costs are expected to trend downwards. And according to one estimate by E&amp;Y, India’s satellite services market could grow to as much as <a href=\"https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/telecom-diary-jio-looks-beyond-the-skies-eyes-satcom-market/89528054\" rel=\"noopener\">$4.7 billion</a> by 2025.</p><p>So you can see why companies are interested in leveraging space internet.</p><p>And here’s the big kicker. Earlier this week, Jio announced that it was<a href=\"https://www.ses.com/press-release/jio-platforms-ltd-and-ses-announce-joint-venture-deliver-high-performance-satellite\" rel=\"noopener\"> partnering</a> with a Luxembourg based satellite and telecom network provider — SES, to offer satellite broadband services in India. A week before that the company went ahead and applied for a satellite communication services licence known as GMPCS — short for global mobile personal communication by satellite services. And Reliance wasn’t the only one making the moves. OneWeb (majority-owned by Airtel)  had done so long before. In fact, they already secured a license for<a href=\"https://telecomtalk.info/oneweb-licence-satellite-broadband-services-in-india/457652/\" rel=\"noopener\"> 20 years</a>, and are expected to begin operations by May 2022. Meanwhile, both companies are expected to duke it out with far more advanced players such as Elon Musk’s<a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/elon-musks-starlink-to-apply-for-commercial-license-in-india-by-jan-31-2022/articleshow/88078847.cms?from=mdr\" rel=\"noopener\"> Starlink</a>,<a href=\"https://www.voicendata.com/amazons-project-kuiper-satcom-service-coming-india-soon/\" rel=\"noopener\"> Amazon’s Project Kuiper</a>, who are yet to make an official Indian entrance. <a href=\"https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/tata-telesat-seeks-dots-nod-for-experimental-license-spectrum-to-trial-services-report/87999977\" rel=\"noopener\">Tatas</a> too have paired up with a Canadian firm Telesat, hoping to kickstart their own satellite-based venture. Setting the stage for a multi-company satellite war.</p><p>Now back to Jio. Its joint venture (JV) with SES takes a slightly different approach from OneWeb or Starlink. For starters, Jio will not explicitly launch thousands of satellites on its own like Starlink does, at least not in the immediate future. Instead, the JV will use SES’s existing fleet of geostationary (GEO) and medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites to make this work. More importantly, SES’s existing constellation of satellites may also be used to extend and complement Jio’s terrestrial network here in India. Meaning, if you are a Jio customer living in a relatively remote place, your internet could get faster and more reliable than ever before. And if everything works out, they could hypothetically be locking in a sizeable chunk of those ~700 million people we spoke of earlier.</p><p>But what about Starlink? Aren’t they the first movers here?</p><p>Well, yes and their satellites flying in low earth orbit (LEO) should pose a formidable threat. But it’s also likely going to be expensive. We already know SpaceX is investing some<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/musk-sees-starlink-winning-500000-customers-next-12-months-2021-06-29/\" rel=\"noopener\"> $30 billion</a> and they may have to convince tens of millions of people to become paying subscribers. A questionable prospect considering the target audience mainly resides in remote parts of the world. And even more difficult to pull off in India, considering Starlink would set you back ~₹1.58 lakhs per year.</p><p>So yeah, many companies are duking it out for satellite internet and we will have to see how all this plays out in the future.</p><p><em>Don't forget to share this article on <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An%20explainer%20on%20how%20India%20may%20become%20a%20key%20battleground%20for%20companies%20trying%20to%20conquer%20space%20internet%20https://bit.ly/3uSSFsi\">WhatsApp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/satellite-wars\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/3JsS5VX&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An%20explainer%20on%20how%20India%20may%20become%20a%20key%20battleground%20for%20companies%20trying%20to%20conquer%20space%20internet\">Twitter</a></em></p><p><em>Also, please checkout <a href=\"https://bit.ly/30TTy78\">Ditto</a> — our insurance advisory service where we simplify health and term insurance for the masses. </em><br/></p>\n",

Second, it also helps that making and launching satellites into space isn’t as expensive as it used to be. In fact, if anything costs are expected to trend downwards. And according to one estimate by E&amp;Y, India’s satellite services market could grow to as much as <a href=\"https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/telecom-diary-jio-looks-beyond-the-skies-eyes-satcom-market/89528054\" rel=\"noopener\">$4.7 billion</a> by 2025.</p><p>So you can see why companies are interested in leveraging space internet.</p><p>And here’s the big kicker. Earlier this week, Jio announced that it was<a href=\"https://www.ses.com/press-release/jio-platforms-ltd-and-ses-announce-joint-venture-deliver-high-performance-satellite\" rel=\"noopener\"> partnering</a> with a Luxembourg based satellite and telecom network provider — SES, to offer satellite broadband services in India. A week before that the company went ahead and applied for a satellite communication services licence known as GMPCS — short for global mobile personal communication by satellite services. And Reliance wasn’t the only one making the moves. OneWeb (majority-owned by Airtel)  had done so long before. In fact, they already secured a license for<a href=\"https://telecomtalk.info/oneweb-licence-satellite-broadband-services-in-india/457652/\" rel=\"noopener\"> 20 years</a>, and are expected to begin operations by May 2022. Meanwhile, both companies are expected to duke it out with far more advanced players such as Elon Musk’s<a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/elon-musks-starlink-to-apply-for-commercial-license-in-india-by-jan-31-2022/articleshow/88078847.cms?from=mdr\" rel=\"noopener\"> Starlink</a>,<a href=\"https://www.voicendata.com/amazons-project-kuiper-satcom-service-coming-india-soon/\" rel=\"noopener\"> Amazon’s Project Kuiper</a>, who are yet to make an official Indian entrance. <a href=\"https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/tata-telesat-seeks-dots-nod-for-experimental-license-spectrum-to-trial-services-report/87999977\" rel=\"noopener\">Tatas</a> too have paired up with a Canadian firm Telesat, hoping to kickstart their own satellite-based venture. Setting the stage for a multi-company satellite war.</p><p>Now back to Jio. Its joint venture (JV) with SES takes a slightly different approach from OneWeb or Starlink. For starters, Jio will not explicitly launch thousands of satellites on its own like Starlink does, at least not in the immediate future. Instead, the JV will use SES’s existing fleet of geostationary (GEO) and medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites to make this work. More importantly, SES’s existing constellation of satellites may also be used to extend and complement Jio’s terrestrial network here in India. Meaning, if you are a Jio customer living in a relatively remote place, your internet could get faster and more reliable than ever before. And if everything works out, they could hypothetically be locking in a sizeable chunk of those ~700 million people we spoke of earlier.</p><p>But what about Starlink? Aren’t they the first movers here?</p><p>Well, yes and their satellites flying in low earth orbit (LEO) should pose a formidable threat. But it’s also likely going to be expensive. We already know SpaceX is investing some<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/musk-sees-starlink-winning-500000-customers-next-12-months-2021-06-29/\" rel=\"noopener\"> $30 billion</a> and they may have to convince tens of millions of people to become paying subscribers. A questionable prospect considering the target audience mainly resides in remote parts of the world. And even more difficult to pull off in India, considering Starlink would set you back ~₹1.58 lakhs per year.</p><p>So yeah, many companies are duking it out for satellite internet and we will have to see how all this plays out in the future.</p><p><em>Don't forget to share this article on <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An%20explainer%20on%20how%20India%20may%20become%20a%20key%20battleground%20for%20companies%20trying%20to%20conquer%20space%20internet%20https://bit.ly/3uSSFsi\">WhatsApp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/satellite-wars\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/3JsS5VX&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An%20explainer%20on%20how%20India%20may%20become%20a%20key%20battleground%20for%20companies%20trying%20to%20conquer%20space%20internet\">Twitter</a></em></p><p><em>Also, please checkout <a href=\"https://bit.ly/30TTy78\">Ditto</a> — our insurance advisory service where we simplify health and term insurance for the masses. </em><br/></p>\n",

And you’re craving pizza. So, you open Zomato, find your favourite pizza, and you’re all set to place your order. But then you see a myriad of payment options. And suddenly you’re wondering — “Should I pay the ₹400 immediately or choose the option to pay the bill later?” The option to pay later is tempting. After all, you don’t see your bank balance drop immediately when you do this. And as a bonus, you don’t get an SMS from your bank reminding you of your transgression either. That’s enough to make you feel good, no? So you choose the option to pay later.</p><p>Now Zomato sees this. And it sees thousands of others like you doing the same thing too. Every day, more and more people are choosing the option to pay later. But something about this makes Zomato a little unhappy. It realises that each time someone chooses to pay later, it loses a bit of money.</p><p>How’s that, you ask?</p><p>Well, when a customer chooses the pay later option on Zomato, there’s a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) company like Simpl, LazyPay, ZestMoney on the other side of your transaction. These companies pay Zomato the order value upfront but not before they keep a small percentage of the transaction value for themselves. And this fee could be anywhere between 1–2%. Let’s take your pizza order for instance. On the order value of ₹400, the BNPL company pockets anywhere between ₹4–8.</p><p>And what the BNPL company gains, Zomato loses.</p><p>Now on the face of it, it may seem like a paltry amount. But what if you keep adding this sum over millions of orders? Well, it could be worth crores of rupees. And no one wants to simply lose crores of rupees.</p><p>So Zomato wakes up one day and thinks it’s quite foolish to simply give away all that money to BNPL companies. And it then announces that it will be setting up its own BNPL company! That’s right, a food delivery company now wants to become a full-fledged fintech player.</p><p>If you think about it, Zomato’s logic here is pretty simple and hinges on two things really. Firstly, it’s betting on the growth of its core business. You see, the penetration of online food delivery in India is still very low. We just need to look at the latest financial numbers that Zomato published to give us a sense of this— nearly 50% of the customers who ordered food on Zomato in 2021 were actually “new customers.” And it tells us that there could still be a big untapped market that hasn't warmed up to online food delivery apps quite yet. And secondly, those new customers will soon be prime candidates for the BNPL play. After all, it’s a market that is booming and it’s expected to rise by 15x, to $45–50 billion by 2026.</p><p>But it doesn’t end there. Zomato knows that if they build out their own BNPL alternative, they could probably get more people to eat now and pay later. This is in Zomato’s best interest. Because when people pay later, they also tend to order more. In fact, many years ago when <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/92178034\" rel=\"noopener\">McDonald’s</a> started allowing people to pay using credit cards, their order value went up from $4.50 to $7. That’s a 55% increase!!!</p><p>It’s basic psychology. So maybe Zomato is hoping to lift its average order value this way.</p><p>And if it does succeed in doing so, they won’t just be saving money using their home growing BNPL solution, but they’ll also be taking a higher commission on the orders. That is the key to profitability. Zomato has to keep the average order value way up, to be consistently profitable.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://cdn.finshots.app/images/2022/02/zomato-graph3.jpg\"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>But wait, what if people don’t pay and they default? Won’t Zomato lose money?</p><p>That could happen. And that probably will happen. But Zomato does have a lot of data on you. They know about your eating preferences, your payments preferences and the kind of money you spend on the app. So it can kind of make a guess on whether you’ll be good for the BNPL type of credit too. And the goal here is not about being a BNPL behemoth, but to keep the customer within its ecosystem and extract maximum value.</p><p>To be sure, Zomato isn’t the only food delivery business that’s eyeing the lending space. In January, its counterpart, the Germany-based Delivery Hero announced that it would be testing the waters with its own BNPL service too. And for both Zomato and Delivery Hero, which are now companies whose shares trade on stock exchanges, the driving force is similar — that elusive profitability mark. Maybe they’ve realised that the world of last mile delivery won’t help them get there. And that to thrive, they need to be lenders.</p><p>But will it all work out the way they hope?

It’s been almost a year since India’s drone rules were <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/the-age-of-drones/\" rel=\"noopener\">first made public</a>. At the time most drone enthusiasts felt the rules missed their mark. They required you to fill out copious amounts of paperwork, get licences, pay sizeable fees before you could own and fly drones.</p><p>The industry lobbied hard and convinced the government to take another look and we got better, much <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/a-new-dawn-for-drones/\" rel=\"noopener\">simpler rules</a>. Maybe, this ban will also see a similar reaction and perhaps the government will find better ways of boosting domestic production while also facilitating foreign imports.</p><p>Until then…</p><p><em>Don't forget to share this article on <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An%20explainer%20on%20why%20India%20banned%20the%20import%20of%20drones%20https://bit.ly/3Bk0459\">WhatsApp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/what-to-make-of-indias-drone-import-ban\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/3gJ4Yz0&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An%20explainer%20on%20why%20India%20banned%20the%20import%20of%20drones\">Twitter</a></em></p>\n",

      "<p>Hey, you! </p><p>We meet again for Week 6. I hope you're doing okay? Maybe put on some music and settle down with your favourite beverage. We'll keep it simple and a little reflective today, I promise.</p><p>Remember Week 1 where you defined your relationship with money? Well, the goals you're going to set for yourself are quite deeply connected to the kind of relationship you have with money. So go on, dig up that old piece of paper you buried somewhere in your desk!</p><p>Before you get started, I really want to make one thing clear — your goals are your own! The worst thing you can do is look at what your friends are doing and then blindly copy them. Did they buy a swanky new car? Did they take a 2-week holiday to Switzerland? That’s their life and goals. But they may not be yours! And for all you know, their “goals” are being financed through debt. What I mean by that is that they could be neck-deep in all sorts of loans. But, the only thing that you see will be their colourful photos on Instagram. So, ignore your friends. Ignore your neighbour. Put your blinders on and think only about yourself.</p><p>And in case you missed it, here's a refresher on all the things we talked about so far: <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/your-finshots-money-resolutions-start-now/\">Week 1</a> (habits), <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/finshots-money-resolution-2-budget-you-bff/\">Week 2</a> (budget), <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/finshots-money-resolution-3-breaking-the-income-barrier/\">Week 3</a> (income), <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/finshots-money-resolution-4-axe-your-tax/\">Week 4 </a>(taxes), <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/finshots-money-resolution-5-buy-protection/\">Week 5</a> (insurance).</p><p><strong>How long will the exercise take? 🕰️</strong><br/><br/>30 minutes. Or maybe 60 minutes.<br/>It really depends on how reflective you want to be.</p><p><strong>Ready? Let’s begin Resolution #6! </strong><br/><br/>We’re going to do this in just two steps.<br/></p><ol><li><strong><strong><strong>Finding goals.</strong></strong></strong></li></ol><p>Everyone tells you to set goals, but no one guides you on how can find your goals, right? Well, let’s change that. Because sometimes, all it takes is a trick to get there. Take retirement for instance. I highly doubt if there’s any one of you who’s reading this who isn’t thinking about retirement. You’ve probably even thought about how much you need to retire. </p><p>But let’s look at it through a different lens. What if I ask you, “Why is money important to you?”</p><p>You might say, “Because it means you can stop working and retire.”</p><p>Let me then ask you, “Why is that so important? What do you want to do after you retire?”</p><p>Now you’re thinking. And you might say, “It frees up time to pursue other things.”</p><p>Notice what just happened? Retirement might be the goal, but your driving force for retirement is something bigger. You might want to pick up that dusty camera in the corner and photograph wildlife. You might want to finally open up that café with your closest friends. Or you might just want to spend more time with family. </p><p>What you’ve figured out now is that you have a big goal of retirement. But you have many mini-goals within it too. You just found your goals!</p><p>Or…you could approach it slightly differently revisit school days — with a “fill in the blanks” exercise. :D</p><p>First, I want you to think about your life right now.</p><p><em>If I want to break out of my  9-5 and feel alive, I would___________.</em></p><p>Then, think about your future.</p><p><em>If I won the lottery, the first thing I’d do is ________.</em></p><p>Done? Do you want to know my answers?</p><p><em>If I want to break out of my  9-5 and feel alive, I would <strong>go on a fabulous holiday with my closest friends</strong>.</em></p><p><em>If I won the lottery, the first thing I’d do is <strong>build a house.</strong></em></p><p>I just learnt two things about myself. First, I have a goal that I want to tick off my list every year — traveling with friends.  So, that’s a recurring goal that I have to save towards. I might still want to travel with family and my partner, but friends are a priority too.</p><p>And secondly, I never thought I want to build a house. Maybe I’d thought I’d buy an apartment. But not build one from scratch. My answer to that actually revealed an inner desire to create and design something that I can truly call my own. And now I’m thinking of a massive piece of land with lots of trees and a small house in the middle.</p><p>Did your answers surprise you? Even if it didn’t, it’s okay. The exercise is to “find goals”. Not “be surprised on finding your goals”.</p><p><strong>2. Now that you’ve found your goals, list them all out</strong></p><p>Take a piece of pen and paper and start listing down goals that you’ve discovered. I want you to divide the goals based on the time in which you want to achieve them. Here’s an example.</p><p>Short Term Goals - less than 5 years</p><ol><li>Emergency Fund - so I can quit my job if I hate it</li><li>Buying a car - a Tesla when it finally arrives in India</li><li>Vacation every year - a plush one, maybe internationally</li></ol><p>Yes, be descriptive about your goals.</p><p>Medium Term Goals - between 5 and 10 years</p><ol><li>Plush vacation every year</li><li>Building a home - a house by the beach</li></ol><p>Long Term Goals - greater than 10 years</p><ol><li>Retirement</li><li>Open up a cafe. Or maybe a wine and cheese bar.</li></ol><p>Yes, I’ve kind of revealed what some of my goals look like too. :)</p><p>Anyway, once you list this out, I want you to do a couple more things.</p><p>Next to the goals, write down the exact year in which you want to achieve the goal. And then write down an amount that you think you’ll need to get to the goal. Don’t worry if you’re off with this number, we’ll get to how you can fix this next week.</p><p><strong>A secret for you 🤐</strong><br/><br/>Now that you’ve identified these goals, you still need to push yourself to get there.</p><p>So, here’s a handy tip — Make it a Vision Board!</p><p>Draw out all your goals, pin some pictures to them. Make it really visual. Put it up on your fridge. Maybe even your living room if you’re artistic. Who knows, it could spark some very interesting conversations when your friends come over!</p><p><strong>The soundtrack to end it🎵</strong><br/><br/>There's nothing like some good old classic rock about money.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://youtu.be/-0kcet4aPpQ\">Money by Pink Floyd</a><br/><br/><em>\"New car, caviar, four star daydream,</em></p><p><em>Think I'll buy me a football team.\"</em><br/><br/>Those were Pink Floyd's goals. And now I hope you've got yours sorted too!</p><p><strong>Coming up next week 📅</strong></p><p>Now that you’ve set goals, let’s make it into a mini financial plan! It’s going to be fun.</p><p><em>Did you enjoy today's edition? We’d love to see what goals you’ve picked out for yourself. Send us a picture maybe?

      "</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"the-story\">The Story</h3><p>2021 was Apple’s best year in India so far. The company sold close to 6 million iPhones last year and they don’t look like slowing down any time soon. Now some would say that’s a drop in the ocean considering India bought a whopping 170 million smartphones during the same period. But here’s some context for you. Apple sold only 3 million units in 2020. And a mere 1.8 million iPhones back in 2018. So 6 million is a massive leap for them.</p><p>And you could attribute this to a whole host of things. Starting with the changing dynamics of the smartphone industry in India.</p><p>More people are willing to buy pricey phones than ever before. According to<a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/india-smartphone-market-shipments-revenue-2021/\" rel=\"noopener\"> data</a> from Counterpoint Research, the average selling price (ASP) in India’s smartphone retail market grew 14% in 2021 to an all-time high of $227 (~₹17,000). This in turn was mainly driven by a sudden increase in demand for premium smartphones (priced at ₹30,000 or higher). And Apple thrives in this segment enjoying  a market share of nearly 44%, with almost all its phones costing upwards of ₹30,000.</p><p>So you can see how the changing winds could benefit Apple.</p><p>But Apple truly shines in the ultra-premium segment — phones priced above ₹45,000. The iPhone manufacturer has a<a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/iphone-12-iphone-11-sales-apple-ultra-premium-market-in-india-price-7950761.html\" rel=\"noopener\"> 70%</a> market share in this category — 50% more than the previous year. Apple’s rise comes at the expense of the likes of Samsung and OnePlus, both of whom lost a sizeable chunk of the premium Indian market. Samsung’s share dropped to 14% from 28% the year before, while OnePlus saw its share dip to 12% from a high of 14% the previous year. When you consider the overall market too, Apple has a lot to write home about. While Apple doesn’t yet reveal the revenue it earns from India, a report in The Economic Times suggests, that the figure could be close to<a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/apples-india-profit-rises-32-as-sales-volumes-surge/articleshow/87476204.cms?from=mdr\" rel=\"noopener\"> $3 billion</a>. That’s for the year 2021.</p><p>Again, you could argue that it’s a drop in the bucket compared to Apple’s total global sales of $365 billion, but it's India — a market where they’ve had a tumultuous time so far. And it is also worth noting that emerging markets could become an integral part of their global strategy soon enough.</p><p>But it’s not just the favourable market conditions. Apple also worked out a better pricing structure. During the last quarter (also the festive season), Apple made the iPhone 12 more affordable by dropping its price to around ₹50,000. And guess what? iPhone 12 turned out to be the most popular Apple smartphone in India.</p><p>Now if you are wondering how this happened, well, it’s because Apple began “Making in India.” Phones assembled in India are a lot cheaper than their imported counterparts and a <a href=\"https://www.businesstoday.in/interactive/longread/how-apple-cracked-the-indian-market-86-14-01-2022\" rel=\"noopener\">story</a> in Business Today drives home this point —</p><p>“Industry estimates show Apple cut the landing cost by about 22 per cent by assembling the phone locally. As a result, Apple slashed prices on the base model by Rs 14,000, or 17.5 per cent, to Rs 65,900 in September, about two to three months after the locally made phone hit the market.”</p><p>In fact, nearly 80% of iPhones sold locally in 2021 were assembled in India.</p><p>Crazy!!!</p><p>And then there’s the retail strategy. They are listening to consumers in India and they’re launching new products here simultaneously when they go on sale globally. A stark change compared to just a few years ago. Remember the time when we had to call a friend in Dubai or an Aunt in the US to bring us Apple products. Well, no more. Apple launched its dedicated online store in India in September 2020. And it is about to open its first flagship Apple-branded <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/apples-own-india-store-to-open-on-22-independence-day/articleshow/85778373.cms?from=mdr\" rel=\"noopener\">official store</a> in India too.</p><p>Despite its record performance, Apple is unlikely to rest on its laurels.</p><p>Android has about 500 million users in India. Apple has around 50 million users. If you ask Apple, how they see this market, they’ll tell you that they’re going after those Android users.</p><p>Okay, maybe not all of them. At least some of them. And if recent results are anything to go by, let’s just say we wouldn’t be betting against Apple.</p><p>Until then…</p><p><em>Don't forget to share this article on <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An%20explainer%20on%20how%20Apple%20cracked%20the%20Indian%20market%20https://bit.ly/3rGoiDj\">WhatsApp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/has-apple-finally-cracked-the-indian-market\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/3gBPA7p&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An%20explainer%20on%20how%20Apple%20cracked%20the%20Indian%20market\">Twitter</a></em><br/></p>\n",

As a result, Apple slashed prices on the base model by Rs 14,000, or 17.5 per cent, to Rs 65,900 in September, about two to three months after the locally made phone hit the market.”</p><p>In fact, nearly 80% of iPhones sold locally in 2021 were assembled in India.</p><p>Crazy!!!</p><p>And then there’s the retail strategy. They are listening to consumers in India and they’re launching new products here simultaneously when they go on sale globally. A stark change compared to just a few years ago. Remember the time when we had to call a friend in Dubai or an Aunt in the US to bring us Apple products. Well, no more. Apple launched its dedicated online store in India in September 2020. And it is about to open its first flagship Apple-branded <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/apples-own-india-store-to-open-on-22-independence-day/articleshow/85778373.cms?from=mdr\" rel=\"noopener\">official store</a> in India too.</p><p>Despite its record performance, Apple is unlikely to rest on its laurels.</p><p>Android has about 500 million users in India. Apple has around 50 million users. If you ask Apple, how they see this market, they’ll tell you that they’re going after those Android users.</p><p>Okay, maybe not all of them. At least some of them. And if recent results are anything to go by, let’s just say we wouldn’t be betting against Apple.</p><p>Until then…</p><p><em>Don't forget to share this article on <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An%20explainer%20on%20how%20Apple%20cracked%20the%20Indian%20market%20https://bit.ly/3rGoiDj\">WhatsApp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/has-apple-finally-cracked-the-indian-market\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/3gBPA7p&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An%20explainer%20on%20how%20Apple%20cracked%20the%20Indian%20market\">Twitter</a></em><br/></p>\n",

You’ll most likely see adverts promoting home loans at a measly 6.7%.</p><p>But if the government wants to build a house and needs to borrow money from outside investors, they’ll have to cough up an interest rate of 6.9%* or higher.</p><p>That’s right, the government, an entity that’s considered to be virtually risk-free has to pay more money than a homebuyer. Pretty crazy, right?</p><p>Before you jump at our throats and say, “Hey Finshots, your comparison has flaws”, well, let’s be clear, this does come with a few caveats. The interest on your home loan is 6.7% today. But there’s no guarantee that it’ll stay the same for the entire tenure. Granted, you could get yourself a home loan with a fixed interest rate, but then it’s likely going to cost a lot more than just 6.7%. The government however has to worry about no such thing. If they’re borrowing at 6.9% they’ll only have to pay this much and not a penny more.</p><p>But let’s set aside this for a moment. Let’s assume that there are no caveats here. Then, you must ask — why is the government borrowing at relatively high rates?</p><p>Well, to understand this bit, you’ll have to know how the government borrows money in the first place. The government primarily earns money by levying taxes. And they spend this money on a wide variety of programs. However, in a growing economy, the government is often forced to spend more than it earns. There’s almost always a mismatch between its earnings and the expenses. So the government borrows this extra money from outside investors in a bid to bridge the gap. And each year, the government outlines its borrowing program in the Union Budget.</p><p>Once it’s made public, the onus shifts to the government’s banker — the RBI. It’s the RBI that helps the government borrow money. And the RBI does this by issuing bonds. Think of bonds as formal “IOU” notes — a promise to repay the loan. And depending on the tenure (1-year or 10-year or something else) the RBI auctions the bonds to potential investors — which includes banks, mutual funds, insurance companies etc.</p><p>Now that we’ve cleared that up, let’s see why the government’s borrowing rate is so high.</p><p>Well, long story short, they’re borrowing too much.</p><p>Covid brought the economy to a standstill, and the government couldn’t earn as much as it would have liked. Tax collections took a tumble while expenses kept piling up. There was no other choice. The government had to borrow. And so it amped up its <a href=\"https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/bonds-fall-in-india-on-higher-than-expected-budget-deficit-aim\" rel=\"noopener\">borrowing</a> program from around ₹7.5 lakh crores in the financial year 2020 to nearly ₹15 lakh crores for the financial year 2023. As you can see, that is a lot of money. And when you’re seeking these kinds of funds, investors will have to be slightly sceptical. After all, there is only so much money floating around. So they’ll start asking for a higher sum to compensate for the added risk involved. And that’s kind of the situation here.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://d3jlwjv6gmyigl.cloudfront.net/images/2022/02/Thumbnail-3.O-graph.png\"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>In fact, the RBI only recently <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/as-rbi-government-cancels-debt-auction-bond-market-lives-to-die-another-day/articleshow/89434032.cms\" rel=\"noopener\">cancelled</a> a bond auction citing that the government has enough money lying in its accounts for now.

So, here’s a short draft (less than 250 words), explaining what this means.</p><p>In December 2021, the global reality TV show Shark Tank debuted in India. It’s a show where entrepreneurs pitch their business idea to investors (also called sharks) in a bid to raise money. The show has been a raging hit so far and it’s caught the imagination of the Indian public. And naturally, the people featured on the show have also been in the limelight.

Needless to say with Shark Tank’s success, Grover became a household name. But bad publicity soon followed him like a homing missile! It all began with a leaked audio clip — where Grover is allegedly heard berating a bank employee. Then came reports of toxic work culture at BharatPe. Soon Grover went on paid leave. It should have quelled things. But that didn’t happen. Instead, there were allegations that Grover and his wife were involved in financial irregularities at the firm. The firm ordered an audit. Reports suggested that Grover could be asked to leave — permanently. And in response, Grover hired a bunch of lawyers to fight on his behalf and gave a bombastic interview to Moneycontrol a few days ago. In which he boldly claimed that anybody who intended to kick him out of the company had to pay ₹4,000 crores — which he believes is what his shares are worth.</p><p>Phew, we made it in 250 words!</p><p>Are we all up to speed now? Perfect!</p><p>Now amidst this brouhaha, something else is simmering in the background. Something that could have an impact on events that transpired in 2019.</p><p>If you’ve watched a few episodes of Shark Tank so far, you’ll probably have seen the other sharks joke about Grover’s endless supply of money because he owns a bank. But wait a minute…BharatPe is many things — it’s a supplier of QR codes, it’s a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) company, it’s a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platform. But is it a bank?</p><p>Well, yes and no!</p><p>Confused? Okay, hear us out.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/rbi-issues-sfb-licence-to-centrum-group-bharatpe-consortium-121101201329_1.html\" rel=\"noopener\">In June 2021</a>, something big happened. After 6 years, the Reserve Bank of India finally issued a new banking licence. And the lucky winner? None other than BharatPe. The then barely 3-year old payments startup had applied for the licence along with the bigger and better known Centrum Financial Services. It was a joint-venture and they called it Unity. Now the licence didn’t allow the company to operate a full-fledged bank like HDFC or ICICI. Instead, it let them operate a Small Finance Bank (SFB). What’s the difference? Let’s just say that SFBs were meant to target the underserved regions in India. But they can take deposits and pretty much lend at will. So in every sense, it is indeed a banking licence.</p><p>But, there’s something else you should know. This license came with some caveats. Remember Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank? Well, this was the cooperative bank that blew up rather spectacularly in 2019. Fake accounts, bad loans — everything was rotten. The RBI had to step in and impose harsh restrictions — on the kind of money people could withdraw from their accounts, and how the bank could function. Unfortunately, the ordinary folks got the short end of the stick as they found out they couldn’t access their deposits.</p><p>So, in exchange for the banking licence, RBI asked Unity Bank to merge with PMC and clean up the mess. They had to pay back depositors who were caught in a lurch. Everyone shook hands, and the license was due any time now.</p><p>But there’s a bit of a problem here. You see, the RBI also has a rule about who can actually own and run a bank. RBI wants the owner to be “fit and proper”. Now, what does that mean, you ask? Well, here’s an excerpt from an RBI <a href=\"https://m.rbi.org.in//Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11649&amp;Mode=0#:~:text=%28i%29%20Age%20%E2%80%93%20The%20candidate%27s,at%20least%20be%20a%20graduate.\" rel=\"noopener\">notification</a> explaining this bit.</p><p>“Track record and integrity — The candidate should not be under adverse notice of any regulatory or supervisory authority/agency, or law enforcement agency and should not be a defaulter of any lending institution.”</p><p>And according to <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/exclusive-rbi-examining-corporate-governance-angle-in-bharatpe-ashneer-grover-episode-8038721.html\" rel=\"noopener\">some experts</a>, the corporate governance issues and Ashneer’s conduct could force RBI to play the “fit and proper” card and pull the plug on the merger. If it does, deposit holders in PMC Bank could suffer in tandem.</p><p>Or maybe it won’t come to that. Remember when we said earlier that BharatPe wasn’t quite a bank?</p><p>Well, we said that because the small finance bank license was granted in favour of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dugalira/status/1489551105839153153\" rel=\"noopener\">primary applicant</a>. And that was Centrum, not BharatPe. Also, Centrum controls 51% of Unity Small Finance Bank. And Grover isn’t even a Director at this new bank.

It is big even for Amazon’s high standards. So big in fact, that until now this seemingly unassuming source of revenue was tucked inside the “other” segment in its financial statements.

      "<p>Welcome back, folks! We’ve reached Week 5 of the Finshots Money Resolutions. </p><p>That’s right, we’re 4 down and we have officially passed the halfway mark!!! And with this, we begin the second half of our resolutions!  In case you missed it, here’s <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/your-finshots-money-resolutions-start-now/\">Week 1</a> (habits), <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/finshots-money-resolution-2-budget-you-bff/\">Week 2</a> (budget), <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/finshots-money-resolution-3-breaking-the-income-barrier/\">Week 3</a> (income), <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/finshots-money-resolution-4-axe-your-tax/\">Week 4 </a>(taxes). </p><p>From the time we started the Money Resolutions four weeks ago, we’ve been bombarded by emails from readers like you. We’ve got lots of insightful questions, but the most common one is always about investing!!! How much to invest, the best fund to pick etc. </p><p>And I promise we’ll get to that fascinating topic. But before that, there’s something that’s really, really important we need to chat about — insurance!!! The life and health kind. Yes, we have to deal with our mortality and the frailty of our lives.</p><p>Full disclosure about me: I waited 7 years into my first job to finally get myself a life and health insurance. And the reason was simple. Investing money in mutual funds was fairly straightforward for me. But navigating the fine print and really mundane policy documents created by insurance companies was quite hard. So I kept delaying it. And delaying it even further. Till a health scare of a close friend jolted me into reality.</p><p>Luckily, I didn’t have a life or health scare in between. But now I shudder to think, what if something had gone wrong in between!</p><p>Don’t be like me!!!</p><p><strong>How long will the exercise take? 🕰️</strong></p><p>10 minutes.</p><p>Okay, maybe 20 minutes if you don’t just skim through it and actually think through how much insurance you’re going to need to sleep well at night.</p><p>Well, 22 minutes tops. Let me explain why. You see, about a year ago, we folks at Finshots realised that good insurance advice wasn’t easy to come by. So, we did something quite radical. We decided to provide that advice and set up Ditto Insurance to fix the problem. Yup, Ditto Insurance is also us! So, if you want a really great experience of understanding insurance, take 2 minutes and check out <a href=\"https://joinditto.in/\">Ditto Insurance</a>. Click the top right corner for the Ditto Hotline and set up a call with our advisors. But only after you read this story, of course!</p><p><strong>Ready? Let’s begin Resolution #5! </strong><br/></p><ol><li><em><em><em>I will insure my life asap!</em></em></em></li></ol><p>These days, most of us start investing pretty early. And that’s because we’re bombarded with stories about the magic of compounding. How if we invest just ₹10,000 a month, we can quickly turn it into ₹1 crore, and all that jazz. We think that’s a good pot of money to have. But in this hurry, we forget that building that kind of wealth takes time. It won’t happen overnight. In fact, even if you eke out a pretty high return of 12% each year, you’d have to wait for 20 years.</p><p>Now imagine you’re the sole breadwinner in your family. You’re dutifully investing to get that ₹1 crore for your family’s future. 10 years later, the unthinkable happens. Your family looks at what you’ve saved up in these 10 years and they find a measly ₹23 lakhs. They look for an insurance policy but they find none. They realise that you didn’t secure their future…</p><p>So, yeah. Don’t wait. You need to get life insurance in place before you even start investing. </p><p>How do you estimate the amount you need?</p><p>A standard rule of thumb is that you take a bare minimum of 10x your annual income. So, if you earn ₹10 lakhs a year, you need to have a life insurance cover of at least ₹1 crore. </p><p>But maybe consider at least 15x? </p><p><em>2. <em><em>KISS - Keep it simple, silly!</em></em></em></p><p>Insurance companies often play to your emotions. And also think you don’t understand basic mathematics. </p><p>A couple of years back, a friend of mine who’d hit the ripe old age of 30 was approached by an insurance agent. The agent recommended a life insurance plan that would return all the premiums he paid during the lifetime of the policy. So if he lived till the age of 65, he’d receive 35 years worth of premiums he paid the insurance company. So, my friend gets excited. Because typically, insurance companies don’t return the premiums you pay them. </p><p>I asked him what he’d have to pay for a ₹1 crore insurance cover and he said it was ₹18,000 a year.  Let’s call this Policy A.</p><p>I checked to see the premium he’d have to pay if he just bought a typical life insurance policy. You know, the one that wouldn’t return premiums. It turned out that he would only pay ₹12,000 a year. And that meant, he could invest the balance of ₹6,000 wherever he chose to each year. Now let’s call this Policy B. </p><p>So, I opened up a spreadsheet to help him make a decision.</p><p>With Policy A, he would pay premiums worth ₹6.30 lakhs. And he’d get it all back when he turned 65.</p><p>In Policy B, he would pay the insurance company premiums totalling ₹4.20 lakhs. But the ₹6,000 a year that he invests (at 10%) would grow to ₹16.20 lakhs!!!</p><p>So, do you really want to give the insurance company your money for free?</p><p><em>Sidebar: Check out the “secret” section below. You might be able to snag an added benefit with the money you save from the insurance company.</em> </p><p>So, what kind of life insurance should you buy?</p><p>Term insurance. That’s it. Remember the word. This really simple type of insurance has only one job to do — protect you for cheap. Bang for your buck!</p><p><em>3. Even if my company provides me with health insurance, I’ll take one of my own.</em> </p><p>Wait…why do you need health insurance if the company already provides one? </p><p>Having employer-provided health insurance is fantastic, but, life’s full of ifs and buts.. What if you want to jump on the entrepreneurship bandwagon? What if you just want to take a break for a few months? What if you just want to retire early? Or worse, what if you get laid off? You probably won’t have any health insurance in each of those cases. </p><p>And if a medical emergency crops up, well,  dipping into your savings will be quite a painful affair.</p><p>Most of us forget about health insurance when we’re young and hearty. Because we feel we’re pretty invincible. But we wake up one day and find that we have a slipped disc, or diabetes, or hypertension. You look to buy a health insurance policy but the insurer isn’t pleased. They refuse the policy or charge you a ridiculously high premium. And then you wonder…</p><p>So, buy a health insurance policy for yourself and your family asap! Because you never know.</p><p><em>4. <em><em>I will disclose everything. Even if my agent tells me not to.</em></em></em></p><p>If you’re young, in most cases the insurer won’t ask you to get a medical checkup. Instead, they’ll just ask you to declare stuff about yourself. They’re trusting that you won’t lie. </p><p>A few years ago, I finally pushed myself to get a health insurance policy. I met someone from an insurance company. He explained the policy. It seemed to cover everything I wanted. Before we went ahead with the forms, I told him about an injury I had. He told me that the insurance company would probably deny the policy if I disclosed it. And since it had been a while since the injury, I could get away with it by hiding it from the insurer.</p><p>But you see, insurers have a funny way of sniffing out lies. I didn’t want to take the risk of paying the hefty premiums and then getting a denial letter if I make a claim in the future. So I made the disclosure and sat back calmly. I was denied the policy.</p><p>See, the thing is, the agent didn’t really care about me. He only wanted to meet his sales target for the year. I'd met him in February, right before the financial year ended. He worried that if my policy was denied, he would be robbed of his commission. </p><p>Now you know why you need someone who can trust? <a href=\"https://joinditto.in/\">#AskDitto</a>. :)</p><p><em>5.  <em><em>I need to keep my family informed</em></em></em><br/><br/>Now that we’ve got so far, you need to remember that you should inform your family about every insurance policy you hold. Where the health insurance card is? Who to contact in case of emergencies or help with an insurance claim? How to proceed with a life insurance claim? Are there passwords they need to in order to access the policies? Everything.</p><p>What’s the point of buying all the policies if you keep them in the dark?</p><p>If this hasn’t satiated your appetite enough, I recommend our more comprehensive reads: <a href=\"https://joinditto.in/health-insurance/articles/health-insurance-101/\">Health Insurance 101</a> and <a href=\"https://joinditto.in/life-insurance/articles/term-insurance-101/\">Term Insurance 101</a>. Trust me, you won’t regret it!</p><p><strong>A secret for you 🤐</strong><br/><br/>How about we get you some free life insurance? With no strings attached!</p><p>Yes, we’re not kidding. </p><p>Certain mutual fund companies offer a free life insurance policy when you make investments in their schemes. It comes with certain limits and rules. For example, you need to make a monthly investment for at least 3 years. Or you can only get an insurance cover that’s 100x the monthly investment you make. Or that the maximum limit is capped at ₹50 lakhs.</p><p>But free, is free no?</p><p>So if you’re someone who has been denied life insurance for some reason. Or you're someone who has taken a break from work for parental duties, and you don’t have a stream of income to show as proof to an insurance company. </p><p>Or even if you just want something for free, you know where to look.</p><p><em>PS: BTW, we only said that insurance isn’t an investment. An investment can still double up as insurance. ;)</em></p><p><strong>The soundtrack to end it🎵</strong></p><p>Rappers, boy bands, everyone knows the importance of insurance!</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/bab-aVRjRe8\">Life Insurance</a> by Tee Grizzley</p><p>If you're not in the mood for rap and prefer something old school, here's another one.</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/IDYtYpr45S8\">Take Out Some Insurance On Me Baby</a> by The Beatles</p><p>You didn't think there would be so many people crooning about insurance, eh? </p><p><strong>Coming up next week 📅</strong></p><p>Finally, we’re going to the part that most of you are excited about.
